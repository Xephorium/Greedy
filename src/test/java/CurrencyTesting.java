  Problem Set #5

    A temporary file intended only to be used in testing each
  of the Greedy application's currencytype classes, this class
  contains a number of functionally standalone methods which
  each address a specific runtime case.
    Note: This kind of method-by-method code evaluation is
  called Unit Testing. Unit Testing is the industry standard
  for large-scale software production and can only be
  accomplished through a unit testing Framework (in this case,
  JUnit).
